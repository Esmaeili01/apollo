# Message Status Update Implementation

## Overview
This update implements proper message delivery and read status tracking similar to Telegram, with different icons for each status:

### Status Icons:
1. **Not Delivered** (⏰): Clock icon - message hasn't been sent/delivered
2. **Delivered** (✓): Single checkmark - message was delivered but not seen
3. **Seen** (✓✓): Double checkmark with blue color - message was seen by recipient

## Database Changes Required

### 1. Apply Database Schema Changes
Execute the SQL script to add the new columns:

```bash
# Run this in your Supabase SQL editor or via psql
psql -h your-supabase-host -U postgres -d postgres -f add_message_status_columns.sql
```

The script will:
- Remove the old `is_read` column
- Add `is_delivered` and `is_seen` columns  
- Add `last_seen` timestamp column
- Create performance indexes
- Set existing messages as delivered

### 2. Update Database Policies
Apply the updated policies to allow receivers to mark messages as seen:

```bash
# Apply the updated policies
psql -h your-supabase-host -U postgres -d postgres -f db_policies.sql
```

## How It Works

### Message Sending
- When a message is sent, `is_delivered` is automatically set to `true`
- `is_seen` starts as `false`

### Message Receiving
- When messages are fetched or received via realtime, they are automatically marked as seen
- The `_markReceivedMessagesAsSeen()` function updates all unread messages from the contact
- Individual messages are marked as seen when received in real-time

### Status Icons Display
The `_MessageStatusIcons` widget shows different icons based on the message status:

```dart
if (!isDelivered)
  // Clock icon for not sent
  Icon(Icons.access_time, ...)
else if (isDelivered && !isSeen)  
  // Single checkmark for delivered
  Icon(Icons.done, ...)
else if (isDelivered && isSeen)
  // Blue double checkmark for seen
  Icon(Icons.done_all, color: Colors.blue, ...)
```

### Real-time Updates
- Subscribes to both INSERT and UPDATE events on the messages table
- When messages are marked as seen, the UI updates immediately
- Status changes are synced across all devices in real-time

## Code Changes Summary

### 1. Database Schema (`db_tables.sql`)
- Replaced `is_read` with `is_delivered` and `is_seen` 
- Added `last_seen` timestamp

### 2. Database Policies (`db_policies.sql`)
- Added policy allowing receivers to update message status
- Restricted updates to only status fields (security)

### 3. Flutter Code (`private_chat.dart`)
- New `_MessageStatusIcons` widget with proper Telegram-like icons
- `_markMessageAsSeen()` and `_markReceivedMessagesAsSeen()` functions
- Updated realtime subscriptions to handle UPDATE events
- Modified message sending to set proper initial status

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Databases:
1. The migration script sets all existing messages as `is_delivered = true`
2. Existing `is_read` data will be lost (by design, as we're implementing a more granular system)
3. Performance indexes are added for efficient querying

### Testing:
1. Send a message from User A to User B
2. Verify User A sees clock icon initially, then single checkmark when delivered
3. When User B opens the chat, User A should see blue double checkmark
4. Test real-time updates by having both users open simultaneously

## Performance Considerations

- Added database indexes for efficient status queries
- Only unread messages are updated when marking as seen
- Real-time subscriptions are optimized to prevent duplicate updates

## Security

- Receivers can only update status fields (`is_seen`, `is_delivered`, `last_seen`)
- Content, type, and media_url cannot be modified by receivers
- All updates are protected by RLS policies
